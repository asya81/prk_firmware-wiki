## Valid version

0.9.6+

## Feature
- Syncs RGB blinking between both halves
- Keycodes related to RGB (see [RGB-feature](https://github.com/picoruby/prk_firmware/wiki/RGB-feature)) work on not only anchor but also partner half

## In your `keymap.rb`

```ruby
kbd = Keyboard.new
kbd.split = true
kbd.mutual_uart_at_my_own_risk = true
```

## Caution‚ùó
- Turning on `Keyboard#mutual_uart_at_my_own_risk` is an **experimental** feature
  - It may make the keyboard unstable and may **break your chip**üî•
- Make sure to disconnect the TRS(TRRS) cable when you change this option. Reconnect it after changing BOTH halves
  1. Disconnect the USB cable and the TR(R)S cable
  2. Connect the USB cable to a half, flash prk_firmware-*.uf2 and your `keymap.rb` that configures `mutual_uart_at_my_own_risk = true`
  3. Disconnect the USB cable
  4. Connect the USB cable to the other half, flash prk_firmware-*.uf2 and your `keymap.rb` that configures `mutual_uart_at_my_own_risk = true`
  5. Disconnect the USB cable
  6. Connect the TR(R)S cable
  7. Eventually, connect the USB cable to the anchor half
